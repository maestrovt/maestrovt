- 👋 Hi, I’m @maestrovt
- 👀 I’m interested in data sonification and bitcoin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, bitcoin technology.

I am particularly interested in developing the technology for application to monitoring a bitcoin full node and related applications (electrs, dojo, lightning, etc.)
